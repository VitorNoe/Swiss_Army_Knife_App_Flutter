# Development Activity - Swiss Army Knife App

## Activity Description

This activity involved completing and organizing a Flutter project for a multi-functional application, the "Swiss Army Knife App." The main goal was to develop the missing screens and functionalities, structure the project clearly, and generate the necessary documentation to facilitate understanding and use of the application.

## Tasks Performed

1.  **Initial Analysis and Identification of Missing Functionalities:**
    *   Analysis of the `pasted_content.txt` file to understand the application requirements.
    *   Analysis of the `swiss_army_knife_app.dart` file (initially incomplete) to identify the screens and functionalities that needed to be implemented.

2.  **Flutter Environment Setup:**
    *   Attempts to install the Flutter SDK via `snap` and `git clone`.
    *   Successful installation of the Flutter SDK via direct download of the `.tar.xz` file and PATH configuration.
    *   Creation of a new Flutter project (`flutter create swiss_army_knife_app`).

3.  **Implementation of Screens and Functionalities:**
    *   Creation of the `lib/screens` directory to organize the screens.
    *   **`home_screen.dart`**: Implementation of the home screen with navigation cards for the different tools.
    *   **`unit_converter_screen.dart`**: Development of the unit converter with support for various categories (length, weight, temperature, volume) and units.
    *   **`measurement_converter_screen.dart`**: Implementation of the converter between imperial and metric systems for various measurements.
    *   **`text_tools_screen.dart`**: Creation of text manipulation tools, including character/word counting, text reversal, case changing, removal of extra spaces and line breaks, and text statistics.
    *   **`calculator_screen.dart`**: Development of a basic calculator with arithmetic operations.
    *   **`password_generator_screen.dart`**: Implementation of a password generator with customizable options (length, inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
    *   **`currency_converter_screen.dart`**: Creation of a currency converter that uses an external API to obtain real-time exchange rates (requires `http` dependency).
    *   **`datetime_tools_screen.dart`**: Development of date and time tools, including a timezone converter (simplified), date difference calculator, stopwatch, and timer (requires `intl` dependency).
    *   Update of `main.dart` to integrate the new screens and configure routes and navigation (Drawer).
    *   Movement of the main application content to `swiss_army_knife_app.dart` for better modularization.

4.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Addition of `http` and `intl` dependencies to the `pubspec.yaml` file using `flutter pub add`.

5.  **Folder Structure Organization:**
    *   Confirmation of the project's folder structure, ensuring that files are logically organized.

6.  **Documentation Generation:**
    *   Creation and population of the `README.md` file with detailed information about the application, features, project structure, how to run, and dependencies.
    *   Creation and population of the `ATIVIDADE.md` file (this document) describing the tasks performed during development.

## Next Steps (for the user)

*   **Test the Application:** It is recommended that the user compiles and runs the application on an emulator or real device to verify all functionalities.
*   **Customization:** The user can customize the theme, add new tools, or enhance existing ones.
*   **Publishing:** If the user wishes to publish the application, it will be necessary to configure the build details for the desired platforms (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop).

## Observations

*   The currency converter uses a free API, which may have usage or accuracy limitations. For a production application, a more robust and authenticated exchange rate API would be recommended.
*   The timezone converter is a simplified implementation. For accurate and complete conversions, the use of a more advanced timezone library would be ideal.

This activity resulted in a functional and well-structured Flutter application, ready to be tested and expanded.
